9th attempt, biggest set of changes yet!

FOund that the lower reward was going down to like -180
Not because of dt
Something from the drain
But what was casung the drain to be so large occationally?
Putting down this to floating point calc error as couldnt see any problem with any of the variables

Capped it at -6, as in conjustion with the other -2 this puts it roughly on par with the +8 maximum reward

Normalised all normal (non-termenal) responses between -1 and 1

Now prints the total reward per game
Now prints the total training loss per game
